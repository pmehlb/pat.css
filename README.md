# pat.css
I'll be honest - I love Bootstrap. The classes are named well and are concise, and the styling is consistent and pleasing. But while I like the utility classes and their conventions, sometimes you wanna spice it up. That's where pat.css comes in.

Also, I'm using this as an introduction to SCSS - what a great oppurtunity.
